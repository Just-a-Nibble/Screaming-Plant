    <h1>Placeholder!</h1>
    <p>You probably shouldn't be seeing this. If you are, one of two things are happening:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You're in development mode, in which case the frontend should be served on a different port.</li>
      <li>You're in production mode, and something went wrong; the frontend bundle didn't copy. If this happens,
          file a bug report at <a href="https://github.com/Just-a-Nibble/Screaming-Plant/issues">Just-a-Nibble/Screaming-Plant</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
